## Description
This project is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q) challenge. I built it using SASS and React (setup with Vite) along with a Figma design. View the live website [here](https://skilled-elearning-lp-nathan-soussana.netlify.app).

## Learnings
Instead of using SCSS as I was until now, I tried the cleaner SASS syntax by using indentation and removing curly brackets and semi-columns. I definitely enjoyed how cleaner my code looked like as a result. I'm curious whether the SASS syntax is easily scalable to bigger projects, or if SCSS suits more complex CSS code better.
