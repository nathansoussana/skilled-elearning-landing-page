## Description
This landing page is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q) challenge.<br>
I built it using SASS and React along with a Figma design.

## Learnings
Instead of using SCSS as I did in the past, I tried for the first time the pure SASS syntax by using indentation and by removing curly brackets and semi-columns. I definitely enjoyed how cleaner my CSS was looking like as a result. I'm curious whether SASS is scalable to bigger projects, or if the SCSS syntax suits longer CSS files better.
